# Open Infrastructure Documentation for Cl4ndestina - OID Cl4n
The infrastructure documentation project aims to provide a foundation for anyone who wants to have their own web hosting infrastructure. Several issues are addressed in this project, from techniques to policies. Everyone has already come across some documentation in their life: whether reading a manual to fix some home appliance, or some linux manual. Here, you have the opportunity to contribute to building this documentation platform.
