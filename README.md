Open Infrastructure Documentation - Cl4ndestina

The infrastructure documentation project aims to provide a foundation for anyone who wants to have their own web hosting infrastructure. Several issues are addressed in this project, from techniques to policies. Everyone has already come across some documentation in their life: whether reading a manual to fix some home appliance, or some linux manual. Here, you have the opportunity to contribute to building this documentation platform.

To build this platform, we are interviewing some sysadmin and asking them what makes a good infrastructure documentation? This answer goes among political, social and technical issues.

We are going to show the preliminary results of our research at MozFest 2018 in London this year. Show up and know how to contribute.
